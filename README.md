# Farming Chia's cryptocoin by using a Raspberry Pi

As enthusiasts of technology and digital assets, we must support projects that reduce the environmental impact that occurs due to the operation of traditional blockchains. In addition, we must propose and develop new open source solutions to accelerate the adoption of these projects in our daily life.

This project intends to present a way of farming Chia's crypto coin by using a raspberry pi connected to a solar electric system. 

## The benefits
- You could have passive incomes with little investments.
- You will make a statement supporting new projects with less environmental impact.
- You will learn about how to farming crypto coins and connecting the hardware with your solar electric system.
- You will contribute to the crypto technologies adoption.

## For this project, you will need
- A Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB at least).
- Raspberry Pi case, perhaps one of the best Raspberry Pi cases, with cooling.
- An external USB storage drive or SSD / HDD with a USB 3.0 caddy.
- A 16GB Micro SD card or larger.
- Raspberry Pi Imager tool [https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/].
- Accessories to use your Raspberry Pi 4 [mouse, screen, keyboard].

## Extra Ideas to accelerate adoption and make the world a better place
- To connect everything to a solar electric system.
- To implement this with communities that need extra funds.
